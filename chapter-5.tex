\chapter{Machine Learning Basics}

Overview:
\begin{itemize}
  \item what is a learning algorithm?
  \item fitting training data (to a model) is a different beast altogether from
    finding new patterns that generalize to new data
  \item for more reading, read Murphy (2012) or Bishop (2006)
  \item most ML algorithms have settings called \textit{hyperparameters}
  \item \textbf{machine learning is essentially a form of applied statistics
      with an increased emphasis on the use of computers to statistically
      estimate complicated functions and a decreased emphasis on proving
      confidence intervals around these functions}
  \item frequentist estimators and Bayseian inference
  \item supervised vs unsupervised learning
  \item most ML algorithms are based on an optimization algorithm called
    \textbf{stochastic gradient descent}
  \item the main components for an ML algorithm are: an optimization algorithm,
    a cost function, a model, a dataset
  \item factors that limit the ability of traditional machine learning to
    generalize
\end{itemize}
